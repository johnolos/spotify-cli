# spotify-cli

### work in progress


Vision:

Control spotify through the terminal.

Have a decent [tui](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs) which uses a fuzzy-matcher for selecting artists and albums.

Spotify currently offers great api to controll your music, but not play it. The idea is to leave spotify playing
in the background on your PC or control your [Spotify Connect](https://www.spotify.com/au/connect/)-supported equipment from your terminal.

I do realize this is a nich√© for the odd folkes who live in the terminal - consider it a learn rust by doing project.
